## Disclaimer

This is far from a one-to-one, high fidelity reproduction of the original sign.

I have carried out this vectorization for cosmetic purposes, its inteded use being printing a new sign to put in [*Bunker San Michele*](https://goo.gl/maps/dDtiNgSph5jxkdhC7), a restored cold-war era Italian fortification (1969-1992).
More details, mostly in Italian, here:

The chosen font, a reproduction of an old version of [DIN 1451](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_1451), is a reasonably close match to the original.

Borders, other geographical features, and translations were kept as close as possibile to the original sign.
They may be outdated and are by no means authoritative, nor imply endorsement by the author.

Few pictures of the original sign can be found, e.g. the one available [here](http://fanteriadarresto.altervista.org/opere_armamenti.html) ([archived link](https://web.archive.org/web/20191224211438/http://fanteriadarresto.altervista.org/opere_armamenti.html)).
